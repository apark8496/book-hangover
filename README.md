# The Book Hangover Cure: Book Generator 2.0 
This is an updated version of my first bootcamp project using MERN to create the app.
A book generator that allows the reader to search a book that they are interested in or already read and get several related books as well. To add a little spice as a play on the website title, (and a personal interest) the reader is also provided with a random cocktail to try with the book they searched.

## User Story:
As a reader when I am interested in a book I like to add it to a list to keep track and be able to find similar books to know what to read next

As an added bonus when searching, a drink to try while reading their chosen book! or to help cure the book hangover!

### Technologies:
-CSS Framework: VBootstrap
-Javascript framework: Jquery
### APIs:
-Google Books: to search for book by title and get similar books
-CocktailDB: Provides a random drink for the reader to try with the book they searched
